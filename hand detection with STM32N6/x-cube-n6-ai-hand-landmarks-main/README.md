# x-cube-n6-ai-hand-landmarks Application

Computer Vision application demonstrating the deployment of several object detection models execution in series on the STM32N6570-DK or NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board. The chosen use case is single-hand landmark detection. It consists of two models that execute sequentially:

1. A palm detection (pd) model is executed in the first stage to detect the hand’s palm.
2. A hand landmark (hl) detection model is executed in the second stage to identify the landmarks of the hand detected during the first stage. After the execution of the first model, a resize operation takes place to provide the expected input to the second model.
   On STM32N6570-DK GPU2D is used to also perform a rotation to orient hand vertically.

This top README gives an overview of the app. Additional documentation is available in the [Doc](./Doc/) folder.

## Boot Modes

The STM32N6 series does not have internal flash memory. To retain firmware after a reboot, program it into the external flash. Alternatively, you can load firmware directly into SRAM (development mode), but note that the program will be lost if the board is powered off in this mode.

Development Mode: used for loading firmware into RAM during a debug session or for programming firmware into external flash.

Boot from Flash: used to boot firmware from external flash.

## Quickstart using Source Code

Before building and running the application, you must program `palm_detector_data.hex` and `hand_landmark_data.hex` (model weights and biases). This only needs to be done once unless you change the AI model. See [Quickstart using prebuilt binaries](#quickstart-using-prebuilt-binaries) for details.

For more information about boot modes, see [Boot Overview](Doc/Boot-Overview.md).

1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    make -j8
    ```
2. Start a GDB server connected to the STM32 target:
    ```bash
    ST-LINK_gdbserver -p 61234 -l 1 -d -s -cp <path-to-stm32cubeprogramer-bin-dir> -m 1 -g
    ```

### Application Build and Run - Boot from Flash

Set your board to [development mode](#development-mode).

#### Build the Application

##### STM32CubeIDE

Double-click `STM32CubeIDE/<board_name>/.project` to open the project in STM32CubeIDE. Build the project.

##### IAR EWARM

Double-click `EWARM/<board_name>/x-cube-n6-ai-hand-landmarks-dk.eww` to open the project in IAR. Build the project.

##### Makefile

Ensure all required tools are in your PATH, then build the project:

```bash
make -j8
```

#### Program the Firmware in the External Flash

After building the application, you must add a signature to the binary file:

```bash
STM32_SigningTool_CLI -bin build/Project.bin -nk -t ssbl -hv 2.3 -o build/Project_sign.bin
```

Program the signed binary at address `0x70100000`.

On STM32N6570-DK:

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w build/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000
```

On NUCLEO-N657X0-Q:

```bash
export NUEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX25UM51245G_STM32N6570-NUCLEO.stldr"

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w build/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000
```

__Note__: Only the application binary needs to be programmed if `fsbl` and networks data have already been programmed.

Set your board to [boot from flash](#boot-from-flash) mode and power cycle to boot from external flash.
